# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

This repository has been woven together using several sources. The ordering and many of the practice problems come from Cracking the Coding Interview, while several of the templates and practice problems come from Rithm School labs I have completed. The purpose of this repository is to provide a space for comprehensive practice on the most common data structures and algorithms by providing a structured layout and list of things to complete ranging from pure data structure implementations to applications of a variety of data structures and algorithms to solve a dynamic problems.
